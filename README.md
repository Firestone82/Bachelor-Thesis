# Bachelor Thesis: **Trails Through Shadows**
**Author:** Pavel Mikula (MIK0486)  
**Year of Graduation:** 2024  
**[Thesis on DSpace](https://dspace.vsb.cz/handle/10084/153760)**  

## Thesis Overview üéì
The primary goal of this thesis was to design and develop a hybrid narrative evolutionary game that integrates both physical and virtual components. 
The game combines a physically playable board with a digital interface (accessible via phone, laptop, or projector). This virtual environment guides 
players through setting up and evolving game scenarios, with features such as dungeon exploration and branching narratives.

The project also involved creating a game model, complete with rules and systems to govern player behavior and interaction.

## About **Trails Through Shadows** üôå
**Trails Through Shadows** is a narrative tabletop game that blends traditional board game mechanics with modern technology. 
It draws inspiration from titles like **Gloomhaven** and **Forgotten Waters**, evident in its combat system and branching narrative paths driven by player choices.

Players utilize both physical components and digital tools to progress through an immersive, story-rich experience.

## Teamwork üí™
This thesis was developed collaboratively with:
- [Barbora Kovalsk√°](https://github.com/Kkobarii)
- [Martin Korotwitschka](https://github.com/rcMarty)
- [Miroslav Osoba](https://github.com/Orfian)

Despite our limited experience working as a team, we managed to synchronize our efforts effectively, leveraging knowledge gained during our studies to achieve our goals.

## My Contribution üßë‚Äçüíª
Our work was divided into four main sections:
1. **[Backend (API)](https://github.com/Trails-Through-Shadows/TTS-API)**
2. **[Frontend (Dashboard)](https://github.com/Trails-Through-Shadows/TTS-Dashboard)** ‚Äì My primary responsibility
3. **[Frontend (Game Environment)](https://github.com/Trails-Through-Shadows/TTS-Frontend)**
4. **[Game Logic](https://github.com/Trails-Through-Shadows/TTS-API)**

Full source code of this project can be viewed in our shared organization on [github](https://github.com/Trails-Through-Shadows).

My focuse rested on the **Dashboard**, built using Python and the Django framework with main functionality driven by JavaScript.
However, I also contributed to other areas of the project, for example: Database Scheme, core of API or image prompting.
